  title: "How novel sensors arise in bacteria"
  abstract: "Bacteria possess various receptors that monitor changes in the environment and help adjusting cellular functions accordingly. The number of receptors in bacterial genomes varies significantly and different bacterial species seem to evolve unique receptors. Where do these novel receptors come from? Here, I will consider several basic mechanisms for their birth, using bacterial chemoreceptors as a model. In the first example, I will show how gene duplication serves as a foundation for evolving novel ligand specificities, while preserving conserved signaling determinants. In the second example, I will show how two proteins come together to form a novel receptor in a plug-and-play fashion. In the third example, I will demonstrate how a single alpha-helix insertion transformed a classical ligand-binding domain into a redox sensor. Finally, these three examples will be placed into a wider concept of molecular evolution of sensing and signaling in bacteria."
