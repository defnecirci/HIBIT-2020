# HIBIT 2020 – Poster information

Contributors wishing to present their work at HIBIT 2020 as a poster presentation are invited to submit an abstract through the submission system on the conference website. All abstracts will be reviewed by the scientific committee, and the authors of those selected for presentation will be informed by **October 1st 2020**.

All selected abstracts will be printed in the conference abstract book and assigned a video conference room during the poster session. 

Posters should be prepared at A0 size or similar (841 mm x 1189 mm) and in portrait orientation.

Each poster presenter will be assigned to one of the 4 time slots of the poster sessions. In their assigned time slot, poster presenters should be in a conference room (link will be provided) and wait for participants to join to discuss their posters. Participants are expected to watch the poster video of their poster of interest and join the associated room to ask questions and discuss the research.
